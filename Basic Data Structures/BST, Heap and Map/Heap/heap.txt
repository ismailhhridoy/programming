heap should be like Complete binary tree — every level is completely filled except possibly the last.
Last level filled from left — nodes on the last level are as far left as possible.
Max-heap input: each parent should be greater or equal than its children (root is maximum).
Min-heap input: each parent should be lower or equal than its children (root is minimum).

Formula: 

left child index = 2*i + 1

right child index = 2*i + 2

parent index = (i - 1) // 2

insert/delete complexity O(logn)
